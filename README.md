# sketch-games

Simple games created in Common Lisp using the sketch graphics framework!

This repo will be updated whenever I make a new game.

# How to run these games

First you will need to install [sketch](https://github.com/vydd/sketch).

Then, load sketch in a compatible Lisp interpreter.

Finally, load the source code of the game you want to play.

Have fun!
